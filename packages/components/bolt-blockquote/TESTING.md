# Testing Steps

## Simple Use Case

As a user, I view a simple Blockquote. [View example &raquo;](https://feature-convert-blockquote-to-web-component.boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/patterns/02-components-blockquote-05-blockquote/02-components-blockquote-05-blockquote.html)

### Quotation

I verify that:

- The blockquote contains a quotation.
- The quotation has opening and closing quotation marks.
- If the quotation contains more than one paragraph, the closing quotation mark comes only at the end of the second paragraph.

### Author information

Blockquotes may include the author's photo, name, and title after the quotation.

If there is information about the author, I verify that:

- The author's photo (optional) is below the quotation, after a small space.
- The author's name and/or title is smaller in size than the quotation.
- The author's name is bold and the author's title is normal font weight.

### Decoration

Blockquotes may have decorative borders.

If there is a decorative border, I verify that:

- The border color is green.
- The border appears to the left of the quotation content.
- The border spans from the top of the quotation to the last piece of author information.
- There is a small space between the border and the quotation and author content.
