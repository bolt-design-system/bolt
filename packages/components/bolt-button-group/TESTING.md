# Button-group component testing steps

## Button-group component render as expected (functionally and visually)

The server-side pre-rendered `bolt-button-group` component should look almost identical to the client-side rendered version. To verify:

1. Disable javascript and view the [Button-group Demo page](https://boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/patterns/40-components-buttons-group-05-button-group/40-components-buttons-group-05-button-group.html).
2. Then, enable javascript and watch as the Button-group re-renders on the client-side.
3. The layout should not shift, e.g. the spacing and coloration of each button-group item should be identical before and after the web component re-renders.

# Button-group component functional testing steps

Functional testing should be performed manually by the QA team across the standard compliment of browsers. In each scenario, browser-type is specified when necessary. If browser type is not specified, the test applies to both "desktop" and "mobile" browsers.
