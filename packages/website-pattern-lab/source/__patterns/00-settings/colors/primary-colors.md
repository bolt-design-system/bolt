title: Primary Palette
---

Our primary palette consists of our primary brand color (Pega Blue), and a range of grays that goes from warm (in the lightest shades) to cool (in the darker shades). They should be used for body copy, section backgrounds and links. In body copy, Pega Blue should only be used for links.
