## Description
Cards are shadowed containers that group together relevant and actionable information.

<aside class="c-bds-callout c-bds-callout--notice u-bolt-margin-bottom-large">
	<p>Looking for docs on the old (deprecated) Card component? Please refer to the
		<a href="https://v2-13-2.boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/?p=viewall-components-card" target="_blank">Bolt docs for the v2.13.2 release or older.</a>.
	</p>

  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> in the code, the new Card component is <em>temporarily</em> named "Card Replacement" on the v2.x version of the Bolt Design System to avoid any potential collisions with the old Card component it fully replaces. "Card" is still the canonical component name being used in Bolt v3.x and later!</p>

## Best Practices
- Placement should be in a manner where it is easily scannable
- The headline should call out what the benefit is of clicking through
- Avoid cluttering a card-replacement with too many calls to action
- If the headline can work as link affordance without a button, don't have a button
- If the headline does not clearly invoke action, use a CTA at the bottom of the card-replacement to entice the user
