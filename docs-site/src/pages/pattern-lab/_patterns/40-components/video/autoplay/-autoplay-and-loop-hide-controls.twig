<p>This video has <code>autoplay</code> set to <code>true</code>, <code>loop</code> set to <code>true</code>, and <code>controls</code> set to <code>false</code>. When a video is autoplaying without any controls, it is muted by default. This is purely intended for decorations and not practical. Autoplaying video with sound is against best practices.</p>
<p><mark>Note: setting <code>controls</code> to <code>false</code> will mute the video and is the only currently supported way to autoplay a video on iOS.</mark></p>
