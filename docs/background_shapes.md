Title: Background shapes for bands

https://bolt.netlify.com/patterns/02-components-05-bolt-background-shapes/index.html

Description:
Background shapes bring the brand further into Bolt. These shapes create a background texture for bands. 

The shapes should be used at an angle offset: 

* Set to the right side of the band if there is copy on the left.
* Set to the left side of the band if there is copy on the right.
* Shapes can be used behind cards or thumbnail images (video or just image) but should not make the content hard to consume by the user.
* Shapes should not be used behind any text elements. Doing so makes the text hard to read.
