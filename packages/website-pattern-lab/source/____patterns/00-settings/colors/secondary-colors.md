title: Secondary Colors
---

Our secondary color palette is used for accent panels, colored tiles and icons. They provide visual variety on the page, but should be used primarily to highlight certain featured items, such as marketing assets or components in Pega Exchange. Secondary colors should never be used for body copy or headlines. Certain colors, such as Teal, may be used for accent text or links. Additionally, they should always be shown as a solid color, and never as part of a gradient.
