# bolt/background-shapes
A grid of colored vector shapes for use in backgrounds. Part of the Bolt “Components” CSS framework that powers the [Bolt Design System](https://www.boltdesignsystem.com).
This component will likely not be used on its own, but rather will be a dependency of another component that includes it.

## Demo

```
{% include "@bolt/background-shapes.twig" with {
    "shapeGroup": "B"
}%}
```
