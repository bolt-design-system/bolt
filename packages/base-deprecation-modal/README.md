A simple, design-system-decoupled modal that automatically alerts users of major upcoming changes (ex. dropping IE 11 browser support) in the Bolt Design System.

###### Install via NPM
```
npm install @bolt/deprecation-modal
```

Unlike most of the other components shipping in the Bolt Design System, this one doesn't require any additional build steps (ex. compiling Sass or JS) - it just works!
