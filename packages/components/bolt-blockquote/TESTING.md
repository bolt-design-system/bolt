# Testing Steps

## Simple Use Case

As a user, I view a simple Blockquote. [View example &raquo;](http://boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/patterns/40-components-blockquote-05-blockquote/40-components-blockquote-05-blockquote.html)

### Quotation

Blockquotes must have quotation marks. [View example &raquo;](http://boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/patterns/40-components-blockquote-05-blockquote/40-components-blockquote-05-blockquote.html)

I verify that:

- The blockquote contains a quotation.
- The quotation has opening and closing quotation marks.
- If the quotation contains more than one paragraph, the closing quotation mark comes only at the end of the second paragraph.

## Advanced usage

### Author information

Blockquotes may include the author's photo, name, and title after the quotation. [View example &raquo;](http://boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/patterns/40-components-blockquote-10-blockquote-alignItems-variation/40-components-blockquote-10-blockquote-alignItems-variation.html)

If there is information about the author, I verify that:

- The author's photo (optional) is below the quotation, after a small space.
- The author's name and/or title is smaller in size than the quotation.
- The author's name is bold and the author's title is normal font weight.

### Decoration

Blockquotes may have decorative borders. [View example &raquo;](http://boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/patterns/40-components-blockquote-20-blockquote-border-variation/40-components-blockquote-20-blockquote-border-variation.html)

If there is a decorative border, I verify that:

- The border color is green.
- The border appears to the left, right, left-right or top-bottom, of the quotation content.
- The horizontal border spans from the top of the quotation to the last piece of author information.
- The vertical border spans symmetrically from center of the quotation and is not bigger than 300px.
- There is a small space between the border and the quotation and author content.

### Indention

Blockquotes may have indent. [View example &raquo;](http://boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/patterns/40-components-blockquote-15-blockquote-indent-variation/40-components-blockquote-15-blockquote-indent-variation.html)

If there is an indent applied, I verify that:

- There is a small margin on the left and right sides of the blockquote.
