The [Twig docs](http://twig.symfony.com/doc/1.x) are the fundamental foundation to learn first; know a lot about the core features!

In Pattern Lab we use [pattern-lab/drupal-twig-extensions](https://github.com/pattern-lab/drupal-twig-extensions) to stub in many of Drupal Twig Functions and Filters.
