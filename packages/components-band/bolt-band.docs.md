## A Band Layout

Bands are an example of a layout. It doesn't have any content of its own, it is only used to collect and display components.

You could add other paramaters to a layout including grid/flex-box, background color, padding options, element queries etc.

If you're tempted to add a title or button to the band consider breaking those out into separate components. This not only makes those titles/buttons reusable, and makes the bands more flexible, but it keeps the purpose of the band layout pure.
