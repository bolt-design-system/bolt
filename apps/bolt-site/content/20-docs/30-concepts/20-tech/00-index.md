Bolt uses [Node](https://nodejs.org) for core processing and scripting to run front-end build tasks and to interface with the Pattern Lab PHP core library, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage project dependencies, and [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) for versioning and publishing individual packages in Bolt to NPM, in addition to symlinking any local Bolt packages that depend on one-another for local development.
