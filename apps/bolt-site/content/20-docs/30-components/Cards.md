*For full examples with variations and API docs, see the [cards reference in Pattern Lab](https://bolt-design-system.com/pattern-lab/?p=viewall-components-card).*

A card allows content authors to highlight a specific type of related content. It can include a video, a link to an webpage or download, or some other call to action. Cards are available in all color themes.

## Best Practices

### Try to use singles or multiples of 3.

Cards are best used as either a single card within a Content Body band, or as a set of 3 cards in a single band. Try not to use even numbers of cards.

### Focus cards on a clear benefit.



### Add calls to action consistently.
