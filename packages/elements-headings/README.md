<!--By default, the button atom include three optional parameters:

1. {{ href }}: for the URL href. Defaults to a hash "#"
2. {{ classes }}: for adding additional modifier classes on top of the base "c-button" component class
3. {{ text }}: for customizing the text that shows up within the button.

Icon-specific options will be included as well in the near future as PL is more fully built out.-->
