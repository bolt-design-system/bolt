Tooltip component. Part of the Bolt “Components” CSS framework that powers the [Bolt Design System](https://www.boltdesignsystem.com).

### Install via NPM
```
npm install @bolt/components-tooltip
```

## Description:
The tooltip component provides the user with a onHover Or onClick (button) toggle to display nearly any kind of content or Bolt Component nested within.

## Use cases (not limited to):
- Help text
- Navigational assistance (such as language select)
- Used within other components, such as Share, to enhance functionality and presentation

## Best practices
- Toggle icons should be tested to ensure smooth transition states
- The `noWrap` option should only be used when small snippets of text or content are used
