## Demo: Navigate to Exact Result {id=navigate-to-exact-result}

In this example, we populate the Typeahead component with a small batch of results and customize the `onSelected` behavior to go directly to the result selected (vs the search results page) for exact matches.

Submitting the form with text that isn't a 1:1 match will fall back to the search results page (the behavior shown in the other demo).
