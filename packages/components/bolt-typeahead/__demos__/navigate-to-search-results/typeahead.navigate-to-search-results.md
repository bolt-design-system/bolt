## Demo: Navigate To Search Results {id=navigate-to-search-results}

In this example, we populate the Typeahead component with a larger batch of results and customize the `onSelected` behavior to always go to the search results page when selecting an item.

Unlike the other demo, only perfect matches will allow you to submit (via the submit button) or select a result.

For example, manually selecting or entering `Case Management` in the input field will allow you to submit via hitting enter or clicking on the search icon. However, entering in `Case Management2` instead would _not_ submit.
