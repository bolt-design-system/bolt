# List component testing steps

## List component render as expected (functionally and visually)

The server-side pre-rendered `bolt-headline` component should look almost identical to the client-side rendered version. To verify:

1. Disable javascript and view the [Headline Demo page](https://boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/patterns/40-components-headline-05-headline/40-components-headline-05-headline.html).
2. Then, enable javascript and watch as the List re-renders on the client-side.
3. The layout should not shift, e.g. the spacing in between each list item should be identical before and after the web component re-renders.

# List component functional testing steps

Functional testing should be performed manually by the QA team across the standard compliment of browsers. In each scenario, browser-type is specified when necessary. If browser type is not specified, the test applies to both "desktop" and "mobile" browsers.
