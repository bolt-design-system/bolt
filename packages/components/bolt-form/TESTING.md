# Form component testing steps

## Form component render as expected (functionally and visually)

The server-side pre-rendered `bolt-form` component should look almost identical to the client-side rendered version. To verify:

1. Disable javascript and view the [Form Demo page](https://boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/patterns/02-components-form-10-form-element-demo-input-element/02-components-form-10-form-element-demo-input-element.html).
2. Then, enable javascript and watch as the Form re-renders on the client-side.
3. The layout should not shift, e.g. the input apperance and functionality should be identical before and after the web component re-renders.

# Form component functional testing steps

Functional testing should be performed manually by the QA team across the standard compliment of browsers. In each scenario, browser-type is specified when necessary. If browser type is not specified, the test applies to both "desktop" and "mobile" browsers.
