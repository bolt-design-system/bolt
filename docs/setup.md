# Getting setup with Bolt
**Below you'll find a step-by-step guide for getting your local environment configured**

## Prerequisites
### **Node Prerequisites**
Bolt uses [Node](https://nodejs.org) for core processing and scripting, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage project dependencies, [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) to run front-end build tasks and to interface with the Pattern Lab PHP core library, and [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) for versioning and publishing individual packages in Bolt to NPM, in addition to symlinking any local Bolt packages that depend on one-another.

#### Installing Node & NPM
Node v4 or higher should suffice however the latest v8.x of Node is recommended. You can follow the directions for [installing Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) on the nodejs.org website if you haven't done so already.

Installing Node also installs the latest version of npm by default however if youâ€™ve already installed Node in the past, you should upgrade to at least v5.x of NPM to take advantage of the performance gains npm 5 introduced. 

```
npm install npm@latest -g 
```

It's also highly recommended that you [install gulp](hhttps://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/4.0/docs/getting-started.md) globally.

> Note: Bolt uses Gulp 4, which may require a new global install of the Gulp command line interface.
> 
> Follow the *Upgrading to Gulp 4* instructions below if you already have Gulp installed and need to upgrade. Gulp 4 is in alpha, but brings many benefits to the table and is relatively stable. The rest of this documentation assumes a global install.

##### Upgrading to Gulp 4
Gulp 4 uses an updated CLI which needs to be updated globally. This CLI is backwards compatible with any Gulp 3.x projects you may have locally.

```
# first uninstall gulp globally
npm uninstall gulp -g

# uninstall from your project directory, or delete node_modules if you need a coffee break
npm uninstall gulp

# install the latest Gulp 4 CLI tools globally
npm install gulpjs/gulp-cli -g
```

Once done you can run npm install again from the Bolt repo and everything should be pulled down again via npm.

You can confirm the correct versions are installed via:
```
gulp -v
[22:35:42] CLI version 1.4.0 (at time of writing)
[22:35:42] Local version 4.0.0-alpha.2
```


### Install Lerna Globally
```
npm install -g lerna
```


### Install PHP Dependencies
- Composer
- Prestissimo (optional, but recommend)
```
composer global require hirak/prestissimo
```
- PHP (PHP 7 recommended)

### Homebrew
- Homebrew (needed for easy install of GD and Imagick -- used for responsive images / image optimization)

```
brew install imagemagick
brew install graphicsmagick
```


## Installing

### First time setup

If this is a fresh clone, run the commands below, then go get lunch.

```bash
npm install
npm run setup
npm start
```

<details>
<summary>**What's that all doing? I wanna know details! (click me)**</summary>
Well, since you asked:

- `npm install` - Installing node dependencies listed in `package.json` into `node_modules/`
- `npm run setup` - This runs these commands:
    - `npm run bootstrap` - Runs `lerna bootstrap --hoist` 
        - Looks at `lerna.json` to find where all packages are, then goes to those directories and runs `npm install`. 
        - Since we use `--hoist`, that installs shared dependencies up in the repo roots `node_modules/` folder.
    - `npm run composer:setup`
        - Checks to see if this is a fresh install and if not:
        - deletes `composer.lock` and `vendor`
        - Runs `composer install` to get dependencies from `composer.json` and put them in `vendor`, these are mainly Pattern Lab dependencies.
- `npm start`
    - Compiles everything
    - Starts watches on files that will trigger builds for what was changed
    - Starts up a server

</details>

## Start up local server, compile, and watch for changes
```
## Alias for `gulp`
npm run start
```

Note: you can always run `gulp --tasks` to see what build tasks are available to run

## Building for Production (Quick Build)
```
npm run build
```

## Building for Production (Full Build)
Everything done in the normal production build in addition to regenerating the bolt-manaifest.yml file in the root of the project -- used when dynamically referencing arrays of Twig templates in a way that is more D8 friendly out of the box
```
npm run build:full
```
