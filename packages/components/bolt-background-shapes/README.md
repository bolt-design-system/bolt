A grid of colored vector shapes for use in backgrounds. Part of the Bolt “Components” CSS framework that powers the [Bolt Design System](https://www.boltdesignsystem.com).
This component will likely not be used on its own, but rather will be a dependency of another component that includes it.

### Install via NPM
```
npm install @bolt/components-background-shapes
```
