"Nav Priority" is the Bolt Design System's web component implementation of the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-priority-navigation-pattern/">Priority+ Navigation Pattern</a>.

Typically (but not exclusively) used in the `<bolt-navbar>` component, this component displays a collection of navigation links in a row when the container, *not the screen size*, fits the content. As individal links no longer fit, these get progressively added to a dropdown menu automaticaly, making for an extremely resiliant and flexible navigation pattern.

Heavily inspired by <a href="https://css-tricks.com/container-adapting-tabs-with-more-button/">Container-Adapting Tabs With “More” Button</a>.
